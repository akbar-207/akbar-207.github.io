My gitHub account doesnt have anything yet it is just a plain test run but now I might use it to store my codes and explore more features that i can do using gitHub.
My gitHub repository doesnt have anything special as there was no specific restrictions on what should be added I just added a test file to see what it actually does but since I got to know what happens I might play around with it a bit.
Steps to clone:
1- click file and select clone respitory
2- select the respitory you want to clone
3- choose the file location you want it saved but I auto chose what showed up that is it got saved in my documents folder
4- now its cloned so you can play around with it or add codes share with teammates and more.
